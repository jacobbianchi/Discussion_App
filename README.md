# Statistics Application

This is a Streamlit application that I designed as part of an assignment for a statistics course at UCLA. The application provides various functionalities to analyze datasets and gain insights into their distributions. It allows users to upload CSV files, explore basic dataset information, analyze specific variables, calculate summary statistics, and create highly customizable and downloadable graphs.

## Usage

You can access the application by clicking the following link:

[Discussion Application](https://jacobbianchi-discussion-app-main-ts8ad6.streamlit.app/)

The application is hosted on Streamlit and can be run directly from your web browser.

## Features

### 1. Dataset Upload

You can upload a dataset in the form of a CSV file to the application. This functionality allows you to analyze and explore different datasets easily.

### 2. Basic Dataset Information

The application provides basic information about the uploaded dataset, including the number of rows and types of columns. This helps you understand the overall structure and characteristics of the dataset.

### 3. Variable Analysis

You can select specific variables from the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of their distributions. The application can create histograms and bar graphs to explore patterns within the selected variable.

### 4. Summary Statistics

The application calculates summary statistics for the selected variables, including measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. These statistics give you a concise overview of the dataset's numerical properties.

### 5. Customizable Graphs

The application allows you to create highly customizable graphs to visualize the data. You can customize various aspects of the graphs, such as the type of plot, color schemes, axis labels, and titles. Additionally, the graphs can be downloaded for further analysis or for presentation purposes.
